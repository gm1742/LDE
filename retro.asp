<p>If you're buying or selling a house that has been built, converted, or refurbished within the last 10 years, you may benefit from a retrospective building warranty, also known as a completed home warranty. This type of warranty covers any damage caused by defects in the design, construction work, materials, or components of the structure or the waterproof envelope. It is particularly useful for those who are not already covered by a Structural Home Warranty.</p>

<p>In the current market, many property professionals are seeking insurance and finance advice for the acquisition of part-completed and near-completed sites. If you find yourself in a similar situation, it's important to verify whether the site has a warranty in place and if it's possible to transfer the warranty to you. If not, it's crucial to secure a new warranty, or a retrospective warranty if the units have already been completed.</p>

<p>Having a warranty is a requirement for all lenders and mortgage companies, making it a key component for the sale of units and asset re-finance. Typically, developers who are acquiring part-complete or completed sites will require a finance facility at some stage, and the provider of that facility will want to know if there is a warranty in place. Without a warranty, funds cannot be drawn down, so it's important to make provisions and know the costs.</p>

<p>A completed or part-completed property is seen as a greater risk by underwriters because the insurer hasn't had the opportunity to inspect and oversee key phases of the build. This increased perceived risk directly links to the premium cost of the warranty.</p>
