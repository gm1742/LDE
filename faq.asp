                                        <a>Which Building Projects Require Warranties By Law?</a>
                                        <p>Developers are required to provide them but self builds are not obliged to provide one however it is advisable - especially for resale purposes.</p>

                                        <a>Why Is Retrospective Cover Hard to Find?</a>
                                        <p>It is not necessarily hard to find it is just some insurers will not provide it due to it not being inspected for warrant purposes from the start of a project and it is higher risk. We have plenty of experience in successfully helping to place retrospective cover.</p>

                                        <a>When and why would a PCC be suitable vs. a full building warranty?</a>
                                        <p>A Professional Consultant’s Certificate (PCC) is suitable when the client may not have funds to get a full 10yr retrospective warranty and if the lender for the buyer will accept a PCC. This will only protect them against the design & build aspect with a PCC. It won't protect against poor workmanship faulty building materials and everything else a full warranty will provider cover for.</p>

                                        <a>What's the difference between a "rated" and "un-rated" insurer?</a>
                                        <p>A rated insurer will be a UK based insurer which has achieved a rating from the authorised bodies and un-rated is generally an offshore insurer.</p>
