                          <p>Latent Defects offers Structural Warranties that are essential for safeguarding newly converted and refurbished properties against latent defects. These warranties are particularly important if the development is intended for residential use. Most mortgage lenders require developers to provide a recognised Structural Warranty for each newly-built property before approving a mortgage application. Without such a warranty, banks and building societies may refuse to provide mortgages.</p>

<p>Barn Conversion projects, in particular, require specialised attention to ensure they are insured correctly. Many Structural Warranty providers have stopped offering cover for these projects. Therefore, it is important to engage an expert consultant such as LatentDefects to ensure that your Barn Conversion project is adequately insured. We can provide cover for projects where a receiver is involved, the project has a high reinstatement value, or is being built as an investment.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may recommend a Professional Consultantâ€™s Certificate as a more appropriate solution for a Barn Conversion project. See our page on PCCs.</p>

<p>The benefits of a Conversion Warranty include being recognised by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, accepted by high street lenders, and providing 10-year insurance coverage against major structural damage. Trust LatentDefects to provide you with expert advice and support for all your Structural Warranty needs.</p>
