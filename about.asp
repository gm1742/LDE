<p><b style="color:#8e1915">What is a Latent Defects Warranty?</b></p>
<p>A latent defects warranty, also known as a structural warranty, protects against damage caused by hidden or undetected issues within a buildingâ€™s structure that may not be immediately apparent after the project is completed. These defects can arise due to design flaws, poor workmanship, or defective materials, which may not become obvious for several years. A latent defects warranty typically covers structural issues for a period of 10 to 12 years after completion, providing crucial financial protection to property owners and developers.</p>
<p>At Latent Defects, we specialise in sourcing comprehensive warranties that offer protection against these unforeseen risks. Whether it's a residential, commercial, or mixed-use property, we ensure that our clients receive cover that suits their specific project needs.</p>
